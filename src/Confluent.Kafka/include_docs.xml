<Member name="Consumer_OffsetsForTimes">
    <summary>
        Look up the offsets for the given partitions by timestamp. The returned offset for each partition is the
        earliest offset whose timestamp is greater than or equal to the given timestamp in the corresponding partition.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
        This is a blocking call. The consumer does not have to be assigned the partitions.
        If the message format version in a partition is before 0.10.0, i.e. the messages do not have timestamps, null
        will be returned for that partition.
        Note that this method may block indefinitely if the partition does not exist.
    </remarks>
    <param name="timestampsToSearch">
        The mapping from partition to the timestamp to look up.
    </param>
    <param name="timeout">
        The maximum period of time the call may block.
    </param>
    <returns>
       A mapping from partition to the timestamp and offset of the first message with timestamp greater
       than or equal to the target timestamp. null will be returned for the partition if there is no such message.
    </returns>
