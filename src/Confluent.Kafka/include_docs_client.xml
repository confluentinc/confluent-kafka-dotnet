<Member name="Name">
    <summary>
        Gets the name of this client instance.
        Contains (but is not equal to) the client.id configuration parameter.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
        This name will be unique across all client instances
        in a given application which allows log messages to be
        associated with the corresponding instance.

<Member name="OnLog">
    <summary>
        Raised when there is information that should be logged.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
        By default not many log messages are generated.
     
        For more verbose logging, specify one or more debug contexts 
        using the 'debug' configuration property. The 'log_level'
        configuration property is also relevant, however logging is
        verbose by default given a debug context has been specified,
        so you typically shouldn't adjust this value.
    
        Warning: Log handlers are called spontaneously from internal 
        librdkafka threads and the application must not call any 
        Confluent.Kafka APIs from within a log handler or perform any
        prolonged operations.

<Member name="OnStatistics">
    <summary>
        Raised on librdkafka statistics events. JSON formatted
        string as defined here: https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/wiki/Statistics
    </summary>
    <remarks>
        You can enable statistics and set the statistics interval
        using the statistics.interval.ms configuration parameter
        (disabled by default).
    
        Called as a side effect of calls to `Poll` (producer/consumer) or 
        `Consume` (consumer), on the same thread.

<Member name="AddBrokers_string">
    <summary>
        Adds one or more brokers to the Client's list of initial
        bootstrap brokers. 
    
        Note: Additional brokers are discovered automatically as 
        soon as the Client connects to any broker by querying the 
        broker metadata. Calling this method is only required in 
        some scenarios where the address of all brokers in the 
        cluster changes.
    </summary>
    <param name="brokers">
        Comma-separated list of brokers in the same format as 
        the bootstrap.server configuration parameter.
    </param>
    <remarks>
        There is currently no API to remove existing configured, 
        added or learnt brokers.
    </remarks>
    <returns>
        The number of brokers added. This value includes brokers
        that may have been specified a second time.
